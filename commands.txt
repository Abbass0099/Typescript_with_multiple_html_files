1- global: npm install -g typescript 
2- to run project we can write: 
	- tsc sanbox.ts sanbox.js  
	or if both files are same name we ca write:
	- tsc sanbox.ts

	to make it run always we can watch:
	- tsc sanbox.ts -w

2-  to create tsconfig.json file:
     - tsc --init



3- changing Directory to src folder:
- open tsconfig.json file 
- uncomment rootDir and set to ./src
- uncomment outDir and set it to ./public


now we can enter only : tsc -w
because its automatically go to src as we did in (tsconfig.json) file on (rootDir) line



4- What if i add a file outside src and outside public => it automatically compile it into public folder so th solution is::::::::::::

- open tsconfig.json file -> at end of file add: "include": ["src"]
